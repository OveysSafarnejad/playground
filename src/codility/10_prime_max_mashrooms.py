# You are given a non-empty, zero-indexed array A of n (1 < n < 100 000) integers
# a0, a1 -> anâˆ’1 (0 < a(i) < 1 000). This array represents number of mushrooms growing on the
# consecutive spots along a road. You are also given integers k and m (0 < k, m < n).
# A mushroom picker is at spot number k on the road and should perform m moves. In
# one move she moves to an adjacent spot. She collects all the mushrooms growing on spots
# she visits. The goal is to calculate the maximum number of mushrooms that the mushroom
# picker can collect in m moves.
